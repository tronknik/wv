        <div class="text-content">
       <p>The fee quoted for each trip covers most costs, with the primary exception being air fare to and from the staging city (Bangkok for my 2013-2015 trips to Bhutan and Laos and Vietnam.)  Included in the fee are hotels, meals (except for the occasional lunch and dinner); drinking water; entrance fees for all scheduled activities;  fees, tips and gifts for activity hosts, guides, drivers, porters, waitstaff; a $30-50 fee for contributions to development projects we decide as a group to make. 
        </p>
        <p>
        Upcoming Asian trips include hotel costs for two nights for staging in Bangkok. Trip fee does not include air fare to and from Bangkok, personal expenses for shopping and laundry, trip insurance, beverages other than water.  For New Mexico residents only, I will collect New Mexico gross receipts tax (currently 7%). 
        </p>
        <p>
        Specific information on costs, as well as information on payment, refund, and liability responsibilities is available for each trip on request.
        </p>
        <p>
        Travelers make their own reservations for travel from their home to the staging city.  However, I are happy to provide contact information for agencies and websites I use to book my travel; I receive no fee for any referrals.  If Nancy and I are going to Bangkok for staging  just prior to the trip, you are welcome to travel there with us.

            "I had never joined a group for travel, generally, I avoid group travel, but something about his flyer pulled me in to further inquiry. After connecting via email with Roger, and then engaging online video chatting, I made a decision within days that I would participate in his Bhutan trip. It ended up being one of the most enriching experiences-intellectually, culturally, socially, and interpersonally- of my adult life. <br><br>

             "One aspect I particularly enjoyed, was that the entire worldview behind the travel was to come to experience, learn, and more greatly appreciate the other as well as the self. With a most gracious and respectful tone, Roger and Nancy continuously strived to engage those we visited, people on the street, working in hotels, restaurants, wherever, in friendly dialogue. I have a shyness tendency. Roger is the perfect ambassador type, he seems to engage others with ease and then, gently brought me into the conversation, thus, enriching my experiences even more. It was always casual, comfortable, pleasurable. We had around 10 days in Bhutan, then 4 in India. When I left to return to the states, the sense of goodwill and good-feelings remained with me for several weeks. This was my first group experience and I have all the intentions of doing more, esp with Roger and Nancy... <br><br>

            "Another helpful element for me, I decided to go to Thailand early (approx 2 weeks early) to explore the area on my own...my first venture there. Roger assisted me in finding accommodation in Bangkok and also, in putting me in contact with a friend in northern Thailand. I ended up making a journey to Chaing Rai for about 5 days, and visiting the hill-tribe villages, some NGO's doing work in an area of interest (ending human trafficking) and touring to the borders of Burma. I would never ever have made such a venture without Roger's guidance and direct help in setting things up. It was one of those trips of a life-time. <br><br>

            "The kind of travel that we all did, in Bhutan and also India, to be transformative.  And that is what I think many of us are seeking: quiet transformation like breathing in air. That is also what I see in the eyes of others I have met that have traveled with you and Nancy, I see it in their eyes. No one really speaks of it because it is so personally sacred, but it is there in the eyes for anyone who wants the signals. So yes, give my name to potential travelers…I would love to speak with them… and expect a bus load of takers!!  K.H. Albuquerque (Bhutan & India, 2010) <br>

                12/23<br>
        And now on to Laos, this sweet gentle country that has suffered so much from US bombing but remains welcoming and hospitable. Luang Prabang is a wonderful mix of culture and beauty, modernity and tradition. The old part of the city, a World Heritage site, hosts many tourists and yet absorbs them well. Yes, the restaurants selling lattes and pizza and the night market are touristy, but still we had our “ancient coffee” under the protective umbrella of the huge old mango tree, surrounded by locals on their way to work and boatmen who had just climbed up from the Mekong with their morning delivery. And we stood silently very early this morning with the women on our street and plopped warm, fresh sticky rice into the alms bowls of hundreds of monks making their way through the rising mists of two rivers and received their blessing in return.

                <img src="images/sharing-photo2.png">
                <p>12/25<br>
                    One of the most vibrant and interesting things about Luang Prabang is the development work that is going on there. Today was amazing, spent at @My Library, a non-governmental organization started by Carol Kresge, an American who sees some gaps in the Lao system of education. Our group was greeted this Saturday morning by about 35 young people, mostly from the Hmong tribal minority and mostly male. They were eager to show off their skills and practice their English and we were eager to get to know them. Carol showed us around the small center equipped with computers, board games and books and decorated with photos taken by students, reflecting their lives and experience. Young people flock to this space because they are curious and eager to join the 21st century with ideas and technology their schools do not provide, and Carol encourages every question and interest and constantly looks for new materials to motivate her students.
                </p>
                <p>
                  We first presented two used digital cameras that members of the Enchanted Lens Camera Club of New Mexico donated to @My Library. Carol then divided us Americans and her students into small interest groups to converse and explore with one another. One group of students taught some of us about the finer points of digital photography, another played Scrabble, a third worked math problems together, and my group met with our Native American traveler, Marie, for conversation about Marie’s New Mexico Pueblo culture. These students from a SE Asian tribal culture listened with fascination as Marie described the struggles of Native Americans to stay on their land and maintain their culture. Heads nodded and several students spoke of similar experiences as their tribes have been forced to settle into villages and assimilate into the mainstream more and more. We learned that the government no longer allows books to be published in the Hmong language, for example. At the end of an hour, the room buzzed with energy generated from teaching and learning and connecting with one another—and for the students, from winning a Scrabble game!

                  <img src="images/sharing-photo3.png">
                  <p>
                  But the day wasn’t yet over. Some of the Hmong students climbed on motorcycles and we climbed in our van for a short journey to the edge of town and a Hmong New Year celebration. The young people proudly guided us around the large open space under the trees where young men and women threw balls back and forth in a courting ritual, grannies watched over small children and adults laughed and caught up on the gossip. Music blasted over the colorful scene with everyone dressed in traditional festival clothing—the women in tightly pleated, voluminous skirts and embroidered accessories, the men in black with colorful accents. Lime green was very big. We threw some balls to the amusement of the teens and absorbed the scene, feeling content with a day of connecting with life in Luang Prabang.

        We've just returned from our trip to Bhutan. What an extraordinary place! Just want to share a few images with you. <br><br>

A week of journeys on 12 foot wide roads, through misty mountain passes strung with prayer flags and lichen ropes dangling delicately from fir trees, past waterfalls turning prayer wheels and mudslides after rains, one evening staying in a farmhouse. In the cozy living room covered with weavings, we hung our damp clothes on a line over the wood stove and ate buckwheat pancakes and wild chanterelle mushrooms with chili and cheese and drank butter tea contentedly.<br><br>
 
A visit to a school where 200 elementary children dressed traditionally in ghos and kiras, began the day with meditation-- total silence on the field, eyes closed, hands folded-- followed by an enthusiastic Buddhist chant and a Western style school song about sharing, harmony and happiness. <br><br> 
          
        </p>
          
          <img  src="/images/sharing-photo4.png">
        <p>
        A final trek slipping and sliding, first on ponies (optional) and then on foot, up a steep rain-soaked mountain to the sacred Takhsang "Tiger's Nest" Monastery, where a tigress is said to have flown a beloved guru for a three month retreat. The temples at the top are built  into the side of a steep cliff with a 2000 drop to the valley below. As we climbed up to 9500 feet, the temples were hidden by fog, but at times, it cleared, revealing through wisps of cloud the wooden buildings clutching the cliff face and nestled into crevices above the main temples. At the bridge to the entrance, the sound of a waterfall obliterated our voices and the spray tingled on our faces. The first temple had a statue of the guru perched on the tigress. A red-robed monk sat in a small window with a long narrow prayer book in front of him. He began to chant softly, and we sat and listened. The mist swirled outside the window and the fragrance of incense mixed with the drip of rain and the soft syllables of the chant. <br><br>

Bhutan is a lovely place. It's coming quickly into the 21st century, but as one Bhutanese put it, "We still have the luxury of ethical choices." There are many tough choices ahead, but there's a palpable sense of pride and determination--it's a great time to visit and we loved it. <br><br>

       <p><strong>Worldviews 2000 Trips</strong> began nine years ago, when friends asked me to lead them to visit Southeast Asia, where I had worked for years, most recently as Peace Corps Country Director for Thailand.  Since then I have led over twenty trips, including to Thailand, Laos, Vietnam, Kampuchea, Myanmar (Burma), Malaysia, Indonesia, and Singapore.  I have also welcomed travelers to the unique U.S. state of New Mexico. In 2010 my wife, Nancy, and I led our first group to Bhutan; in Oct. 2013, we will lead our fifth trip there.
        </p>
        <p>
        I have been invited to lead large groups in Southeast Asia, but have chosen to organize my own trips, and to keep them to 8-11 people in order to deepen the experience for all.  To this end, I  emphasize travel to places where Nancy and I know wonderful local people who can share who they are and what is important to them about their community and natural environment.  We want to give back as we travel, so a portion of each trip fee is set aside to donate to social welfare and development causes that the group selects as we go.
        </p>
        <p>
        I lead 2-4 trips per year.  In planning each trip, I seek to combine some of the highlights of past trips with a new locale or set of activities, so that each trip is fresh. 
        </p>
        <p>
        I seek spontaneous opportunities, too, as we travel along.  For example, last year our group attended Lao Hmong New Year in Luang Prabang, Laos.  Great as the celebration was, I was sorry to miss the Hmong pan pipes (“khaen”) performance that is usually a part of the festivities.  But the next day, as we drove through the hills of Laos, we spotted a Hmong man and his daughter walking to his village carrying his pan pipe. We stopped the bus, asked for a song and were treated to a spontaneous roadside concert! And what a treat it was to give the khaen player’s daughter some of the Laos children’s books that we had purchased for such occasions from the Big Brother Mouse book project <a href="http://bigbrothermouse.com">bigbrothermouse.com</a>
        </p>
        <p>Prior to each trip I ask each person about his or her interests and what will make the trip special for him or her, and then try to make this happen.     And, in addition to the planned group activities, all are welcome to join Nancy and me for  early morning photography, silent meditation/reflection, and Chi Kung exercise and, any time of day, for market searches for beautiful weavings and other handicrafts and for local food delicacies!  As we travel, I seek to present anthropological and other perspectives on what we are experiencing.   </p>
        <p>Assisting travelers and local people to connect in lighthearted, non-threatening ways is a delight.  I seek opportunities for us to observe, to participate with local hosts, to discuss together in our group. and to provide individual time and space.  My hope is that we all will deepen through experiencing new ways of seeing and being and, through doing so, sustain and improve our world. </p>
        
            <h3>Brief Biography of Roger Harmon.</h3>
        <p>I was trained as a secondary school teacher and in my early work years taught as a Peace Corps Volunteer in Malawi, Africa, at the International School of Bangkok, and then taught at and directed a bi-national language learning center in Savannaket, Laos.  I returned to the U.S. and completed a Ph.D. in cultural anthropology at the University of Washington, using fieldwork on Buddhism and social change conducted in Thailand from 1972-4.  Fortunately, my career path was to be in applied anthropology:  I worked for 15 years in refugee resettlement and education in Washington State, then in Washington D.C. and finally  in Southeast Asian refugee camps in Indonesia, the Philippines and Thailand with the U.S. State Department-funded education programs for refugees bound for the United States.  From 1995-1999  I facilitated various training activities for Peace Corps, including leading Pre-service Trainings in Thailand, Eritrea, and Kyrgyzstan.  From 2000-2002, I was Director of the U.S. Peace Corps for Thailand.   I speak good Thai and passable Lao languages.  </p>
        <p>While in Thailand, Nancy and I hosted many guests and enjoyed showing them around.  In 2004 I began Worldviews 2000 Trips, based in New Mexico, and in 2008 established Roger Harmon, Limited Liability Company (LLC).</p>
        <p>Current interests in addition to leading trips are photography; assisting my wife, Nancy, in supporting her vital, but aging parents; deepening through meditation, Chi Kung, aerobic walks with Nancy and our dog, Salsa; and, seeking connection within, between and among.</p>
        <p>Nancy joins me on about half of the trips.   She recently retired from teaching English, English as a Second Language, media literacy and service learning in a number of multi-cultural settings, including the Navajo reservation. Nancy spent her Junior Year Abroad in Beruit, Lebanon, and upon college graduation returned to Lebanon as a volunteer teacher for two years.  She currently does volunteer English teaching with a newly-arrived refugee family from Iraq. Nancy has recently partnered with another educator to start a non-profit to provide innovative curriculum materials that focus on global issues http://www.global-awareness.org </p>
